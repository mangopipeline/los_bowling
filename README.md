# los_bowling

Goal
Make a small bowling game.
The game will accept as input a list of rolls with the corresponding number of pins knocked down each roll.  As output, the program provides the final score, the running score for each frame, and a record of whether the bowler had a strike, spare, or open frame for each frame.  Additionally, this implementation should allow for the addition of custom rules.  Submissions should include an example of a custom rule as well as sample inputs/outputs.  


   
   bowling.py is the main game...
   
   short_blow.py is a version of the game with modified rules
 
   test.py is a unnit test with all the data sets used to test the game...
 
   test_print_out.txt is a text file with all the output from the unnit test including the game score, score per frame, and if       
      frames were strikes, spares or were left open.
