# los_bowling

Goal
Make a small bowling game.
The game will accept as input a list of rolls with the corresponding number of pins knocked down each roll.  As output, the program provides the final score, the running score for each frame, and a record of whether the bowler had a strike, spare, or open frame for each frame.  Additionally, this implementation should allow for the addition of custom rules.  Submissions should include an example of a custom rule as well as sample inputs/outputs.  

The following link provides information on the game of bowling relevant to this problem.
